# Deck Check

Fledging project that is trying to simulate opening hands and moves in Magic the Gathering. The entire project is written in TypeScript and currently there are no other dependencies.

The way I've been working is to use the global typescript node program which can be installed via `npm install -g ts-node` then ran by calling `ts-node main` in the main folder. Eventually this should probably be cleaned up and what not, but for now it is what it is.

Everything in here is very subject to change as I'm still figuring out how best to organize and run the project, just a warning.
